# Communication Standards 📣

## Why this is important ❗️

- Effective communication norms are important for every team and organization. This is especially important as teams scale and in particular teams with a lot of new members.
- Having well-established norms will help drive efficiency and execution velocity over time.
  This is accomplished by creating a set of standards for how we expect to collaborate with one another, especially in the engineering team.

## Communication Channels and How to use them 📡

### Slack 💬

We use Slack for team communication instead of email. Email is only preferred when dealing with the organization or superiors outside the engineering team or official notice.

There are three core principles we should strive to consistently adhere to:

1. **Nothing is real unless it's posted:** 📌 Assume no one knows about a thing you are working on unless you posted it on the #pif-dev-core channel. The channel is the single source of truth for our team. Any core decision, major milestone, brainstorm outputs, etc, should have an associated post. If you would update your manager or team members about it, there should be a post.
2. **Reactions to posts indicate you've read them:** 🎯 When any posts are made, the only significant way we can be sure you’ve read them is by reacting to that post. Replying to the message in a thread is also encouraged to ensure you have crystal clarity about the post.
3. **Clarity and tagging matter**: 🔍 Ensure your messages are clear. Itemize your points. Keep it short and clear and always tag those who must see the post or need to act on the post.

### Code PRs 📥

Code PRs are an essential part of our development process. We use them to ensure the quality of our codebase and to facilitate knowledge sharing within the team. When creating a PR, make sure to include a detailed description of the changes you've made and the reasoning behind them. Assign the PR to the relevant team members for review, and be responsive to feedback and comments. Once the PR is approved, make sure to merge it promptly.

## Communication Norms and Etiquette 🎩

### Professionalism 💼

We expect all team members to communicate in a professional and respectful manner. This includes avoiding language that could be considered offensive or discriminatory and refraining from personal attacks or insults. If you have an issue with a team member, please address it directly with them or bring it to the attention of a manager.

### Response Time ⏰

We aim to be responsive to messages and requests from our team members. If you receive a message that requires a response, please try to respond within 24 hours. If you're unable to respond within this timeframe, please let the sender know when they can expect a response.

## Our team meetings 📅

As the engineering team is currently based in Nigeria, all meeting times mentioned in this section of the document will follow the GMT+1 (Nigeria/Lagos) timezone.

| Name                    | Meeting Day        | Time              | Goals                |
|-------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Weekly Kickoff Meeting  | Mondays            | 9:00 am - 9:30 am | The team align on the weekly work plan, execution and dev strategy for the current sprint. |
| Daily Standup  | Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays | 5:00 pm to 5:10 pm | Quick standup to check in on progress, answer any questions, and mitigate execution risk by over-communicating and requesting support as needed. Primarily for engineers but all functions can share updates as needed. |
| Weekly Demo | Fridays | 12 pm to 1 pm | It's the time to showcase the progress made throughout the week to both the team and company leadership. |
| End of Sprint Retrospective | Fridays (fortnightly) | 4:30 pm to 5:30 pm | Review the sprint under 4 headings; <br> 1) What went well 📈 <br> 2) What could have been better 📉 <br> 3) Actions and assignments 📋 |

## Managing Absences, Emergencies, and Time-off Requests ⏳

In order to maintain a healthy work-life balance and address unexpected situations, it is important for our team to have a clear and consistent policy for managing absences, emergencies, and time-off requests. This policy outlines the process for requesting time off, handling emergencies, and communicating absences to the team.

1. Planned Time Off 🗓
    - Team members should submit a written request for planned time off (e.g., vacation, personal days) to their direct supervisor at least two weeks in advance.
    - The request should include the dates of the planned absence and the reason for the time off.
    - The supervisor will review the request, considering factors such as team workload, project deadlines, and other team members' time-off schedules.
    - Once approved, the team member should inform their colleagues in the relevant communication channel to ensure everyone is aware of the upcoming absence.
2. Emergency Time Off 🚨
    - In case of unforeseen circumstances (e.g., illness, family emergency), team members should notify their direct supervisor as soon as possible.
    - The team member should provide an estimated duration of their absence and any relevant information that may affect the team's work.
    - The supervisor will work with the team to redistribute tasks and responsibilities as needed to cover the team member's absence.
3. Communicating Absences 📣
    - To ensure transparency and maintain efficient communication, team members should post a message in the relevant communication channel (e.g., Slack) informing colleagues of their absence and its expected duration.
    - Team members are encouraged to set up out-of-office notifications on their email and update their status in communication tools to reflect their unavailability.
    - Upon returning to work, team members should notify their colleagues and update their status accordingly.

By following this policy, we aim to create a supportive work environment that accommodates the needs of our team members while ensuring the smooth operation of the team and the successful completion of projects. 👍
