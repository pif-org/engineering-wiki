| Slack           | **We use Slack for Communication**.<br><br> Communication within our team primarily occurs through two channels: <br> 1. #pif-dev-core is designated for internal engineering communication, allowing our engineers to collaborate effectively. <br> 2. #pif-dev serves as a channel for general communication, intended for announcements from the Engineering team and escalating any issues or blockers to company leadership to ensure prompt support or attention. |
