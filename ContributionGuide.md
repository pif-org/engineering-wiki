# 1. Create a branch off of `develop` 🌿

Name the branch with your first name pre-pended:
`leslie/cool-feature`

# 2. Writing code 💻

Implement the new feature, bug fix, doc, or enhancement, and ensure:
- Your new change doesn't break anything
- Write a Unit, Integration, or End-to-End test when necessary
- Ensure you fix all linting, TypeScript, and prettier issues
- Pull from develop again and ensure you fix any merge conflict
- Finally, push your feature branch

## Commit messages 📝

Make sure your commit messages are descriptive. Make sure you follow [conventional commit guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

# 3. Create a pull request on GitHub 🚀

Include the GitHub Project task link in your PR description, e.g. `[Task name](https://github.com/orgs/pif-org/projects/2/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=25000166)`

# 4. Submit for review 🧐

- Assign the task in Notion to the appropriate reviewer.
- You can always tag a person on a Notion page by typing `@` followed by their name.

# ✔️ Performing code reviews 🕵️‍♀️

### How to review

- Make two passes over the PR if it's substantial.
    - On the first pass, come to an understanding of the code change at a high level.
    - On the second pass, pay more attention to semantic details.

# Examples

```jsx
var commentCount = 0;
```

You might suggest that this be a let instead of var.

# Remove unused packages, keep the project clean
It's always a good practice to ensure no unused package is install. To verify, you can run
```bash
npx depcheck
```
